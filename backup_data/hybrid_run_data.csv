How does the company address carbon emissions in its operations and what strategies are implemented to reduce them?,"['Our approach\nOur core business involves using data to solve hard problems, and our unique strength is combining engineering skills with an innovative mindset and a global reach.\nThere are three main focus areas that make up our approach to our net-zero goal: reducing emissions across our operations and value chain, advancing carbon-free energy, and addressing our residual emissions with carbon removals (see Figure 10).\nFIGURE 10 Our net-zero approach\nCarbon reduction\nReduce emissions across our \noperations and value chainCarbon-free energy\nAdvance carbon-free energy across \nour operations and value chain Carbon removals\nAddress our residual emissions  \nwith carbon removals   35\n2023 Environmental Report  Measuring our carbon footprint\nWe began calculating our annual carbon footprint in 2006. \nEvery year since 2009, we’ve publicly reported the results to CDP , a global organization that asks companies to \ndisclose information on their GHG emissions performance and management.'
 'When we find that a supplier isn’t complying, we expect \nthat supplier to provide a corrective action plan (CAP) that outlines the root cause of the finding, how and when that company will resolve the issue, and what steps it will take to prevent recurrence. We determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the severity of the noncompliance and the effort and time required to resolve the issue. We expect suppliers to demonstrate improvements to continue working with us. Our goal is to resolve the most severe issues immediately. We expect all other findings to be resolved in accordance with our guidelines as quickly as is practical. While we work with our suppliers to help them address our findings, in some instances, we may decide to no longer pursue a relationship or to terminate our current relationship.\nIn 2022, we audited a subset of our suppliers to verify'
 'Developing roadmaps to \nreduce emissions\nSince setting our net-zero emissions goal, we’ve engaged \nour key suppliers to develop roadmaps to reduce emissions across our supply chain. During Google’s 2022 Supplier Sustainability Summit, we communicated the expectation for suppliers to publicly set targets to reduce GHG emissions. We provide in-depth training for key suppliers on setting ambitious GHG reduction and renewable electricity targets. For suppliers that completed our CDP supply chain survey, 75% reported having GHG emissions reduction targets, and of those suppliers, 36% reported that their target is science-based. We aim to accelerate our suppliers’ GHG emissions reductions through further integration of climate performance into key procurement tools and the development of new mechanisms to drive deep supplier decarbonization.   41\n2023 Environmental Report  Advancing carbon-free energy\nOur primary approach for reducing our Scope 2 emissions'

We’ve formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our \noperations is transitioning to clean energy. Energy use contributes to a significant share of our carbon footprint due to the electricity needs of our operations—in particular, our data centers.

 'Scope 3 emissions\nOur Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our value chain, such as our suppliers, use of our consumer hardware products, and business travel. The majority of these emissions come from upstream manufacturing of consumer hardware products, the production of capital goods we have purchased for use in our data centers, and data center construction.

That’s why, in 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by 2030, aiming to procure clean energy to meet our electricity needs, every hour of every day, within every grid where we operate.

We withdraw reclaimed or non-potable water at 25% of our data center campuses. Due to these solutions, 23% of our total data center water withdrawal (excluding seawater) is reclaimed wastewater and other non-potable water. For example, at our data center in Douglas County, Georgia, we redirect local sewer water that would otherwise be discharged in the Chattahoochee River and use it to cool our facility. Additionally, our data center in Hamina, Finland, uses seawater for cooling rather than withdrawing freshwater.
