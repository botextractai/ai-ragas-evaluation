 'Developing roadmaps to \nreduce emissions\nSince setting our net-zero emissions goal, we’ve engaged \nour key suppliers to develop roadmaps to reduce emissions across our supply chain. During Google’s 2022 Supplier Sustainability Summit, we communicated the expectation for suppliers to publicly set targets to reduce GHG emissions. We provide in-depth training for key suppliers on setting ambitious GHG reduction and renewable electricity targets. For suppliers that completed our CDP supply chain survey, 75% reported having GHG emissions reduction targets, and of those suppliers, 36% reported that their target is science-based. We aim to accelerate our suppliers’ GHG emissions reductions through further integration of climate performance into key procurement tools and the development of new mechanisms to drive deep supplier decarbonization.   41\n2023 Environmental Report  Advancing carbon-free energy\nOur primary approach for reducing our Scope 2 emissions'

To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We’ve formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our \noperations is transitioning to clean energy. Energy use contributes to a significant share of our carbon footprint due to the electricity needs of our operations—in particular, our data centers.

That’s why, in 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by 2030, aiming to procure clean energy to meet our electricity needs, every hour of every day, within every grid where we operate. Achieving this will also increase the impact of our clean energy procurement on the decarbonization of the grids that serve us.'

Indicators from available risk assessment tools, including WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas 3.0 and WWF Water Risk Filter 6.0, are blended with other metrics to evaluate risks related to scarcity, flooding, water quality, sanitation and hygiene, reputation, and regulatory stressors. \nFor our data center operations specifically, in 2022'
 'Our water stewardship strategy  is centered on \nassessing and addressing water-related risks to our \nbusiness and the opportunities we have to not just mitigate those risks, but also create solutions that can be scaled beyond our own corporate footprint. We also strive to partner with others to address this shared challenge.\nWhen it comes to addressing shared water challenges, \ntechnology can be a useful tool to bring visibility to these challenges to enable smarter, more informed decision-making.

 'For our data center operations specifically, in 2022  \nGoogle finalized the development and application of a context-based water risk and impact methodology to generate more granular insights than can be provided by water risk screening tools. It provides a framework to measure and evaluate site-level water risks, and the potential watershed impact, to inform our decision-making process for new site selection, water cooling design, and ongoing operations.To identify and assess water-related risks in our supply chain, we’ve conducted a supply chain water use analysis and a supplier risk assessment using WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, WWF’s Water Risk Filter, and WULCA AWARE . The key risks identified included baseline water \nstress, flood risk, access to safe drinking water, and the level of sanitation and hygiene services. This assessment enabled us to identify priority locations for supplier engagement in Central America, Asia, and the United States.'
 'Climate-related \nrisks\nClimate-related risks and opportunities have long time \nhorizons with high uncertainty regarding how climate trends, policy, and socio-economic factors might evolve in the future. Google continues to build on qualitative and quantitative risk assessments to identify climate-related risks and opportunities, and to understand their associated impact.\nIn 2015, Google developed a set of Principles of Climate \nResilience , which support our definition of climate risk \nand resilience. From there, we created a framework that prioritizes the impact on people (including communities, users, and Googlers), so that it represents the different aspects of climate resilience within Google, as well as the internal and external actors who either influence or are influenced by Google’s climate resilience decisions. These ideas continue to inform how we think about addressing long-term climate risk.\nIn 2020, Google conducted a climate risk assessment,'
